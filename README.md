# Number-Matches
 Accepts a list of numbers and finds all number matches (e.g 1234 matches with 4321 and 2143 etc)

A friend contacted me and requseted a tool that will accept any number of 4 digit numbers and highlight all numbers from that list where a number xxxx has the same characters as number yyyy.
## For instance given a number 4591, the following are valid matches: 1954, 1945, 1459, 1495, 5149, 5194 etc.
